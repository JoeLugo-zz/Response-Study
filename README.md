# Response-Study

This is a study that looks at the SMS response time between me and ma gurl. 

All data was pushed to google spreadsheets using the app [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/). Data is then pulled and cleaned up in the R script. Using the package [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) to create all the visuals.
